            <h2>
                PEAK has a new update called the roots there are a lot of new achievments added 
            </h2>
            <h3>
                mushrooms
            </h3>
            <h5>
                getting all mushrooms in a single run is surprizingly difficult there are four types a yellow, purple. blue, and red. you need to get and eat all in a single run which is harder that the original mycology badge because they can only spawn in one biome. I recommend turning it to tender foot so the fog does not catch up to you so you have as much time to find the mushrooms as possible
            </h5>
            <h3>
                rescue hook
            </h3>
            <h5>
                this one may take some setting up but it is the easiest of the four. get a friend at the bottom of the mountain climb a while up with the rescue hook and shoot them up to you.
            </h5>
            <h3>
                mandrake
            </h3>
            <h5>
                this one takes a lot of preparation you need a portable stove and a mandrake in the same spot and to do this fast or else you will pass out from the screaming but set the stove down and then cook and eat the mandrake
            </h5>
            <h3>
                zombie bite
            </h3>
            <h5>
                this requires setting up I recommend getting a medicinal root from the shore and then when you get to the roots let the zombie bite you then eat the root before you pass out 
            </h5>
            <h3>
                spider trap
            </h3>
            <h5>
                for this achievment you need to get trapped by a spider and be ready to spam space to escape after this you need to use a healing item to save from your fall
            </h5>
            <h3>
                surviving the roots
            </h3>
            <h5>
                for this badge you need to ge through the roots without getting 25% or higher of spores many things give you spores namely mushrooms, zombies, spiders and, the purple fog simply avoid these and you will be fine
